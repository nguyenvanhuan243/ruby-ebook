## How to Read This Book

This book contains three catalogs: [smells](#code-smells),
[solutions](#solutions) and [principles](#principles).

Start by looking up a smell that sounds familiar. Each chapter on smells explains
the potential problems each smell may reveal and references possible
solutions.

Once you've identified the problem revealed by a smell, read the relevant
solution chapter to learn how to fix it. Each solution chapter explains
which problems it addresses and potential problems that can be introduced.

Lastly, smell and solution chapters reference related principles. The smell
chapters reference principles that you can follow to avoid the root problem
in the future. The solution chapters explain how each solution changes your
code to follow related principles.

By following this process, you'll learn how to detect and fix actual problems in
your code using smells and reusable solutions, and you'll learn about principles
that you can follow to improve the code you write from the beginning.
