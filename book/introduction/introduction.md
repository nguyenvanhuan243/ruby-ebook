# Introduction

Ruby on Rails is more than 15 years old and its community has developed a number
of principles for building applications that are fast, fun and easy to change:
Don't repeat yourself, keep logic out of your views, don't overload your
controllers, and keep business logic in your models. These principles carry most
applications to their first release or beyond.

However, these principles only get you so far. After a few releases, most
applications begin to suffer. Models become overloaded, classes become few and
large, tests become slow, and changes become painful. In many applications,
there comes a day when the developers realize that there's no going back; the
application is a twisted mess and the only way out is a rewrite or a new job.

Fortunately, it doesn't have to be this way. Developers have been using
object-oriented programming for several decades and there's a wealth of
knowledge out there that still applies to developing applications today. We can
use the lessons learned by these developers to write good Rails applications by
applying good object-oriented programming.

Ruby Science outlines a process for detecting emerging problems in code and
dives into the solutions, old and new.
